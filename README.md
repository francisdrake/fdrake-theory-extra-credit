# fdrake-theory-extra-credit

I have attached a Theory of Computing "Crash Course" Document containing material (homework problems, class notes, textbook pages) from modules 0-2.
I am not sure whether or not this will count for extra credit; this was a study guide I developed in preparation of and after exams, and if anything, may be beneficial to share with others.

I chose to do this not only as a review for myself, highlighting areas like the Pumping Lemma which I struggled with, but also to maybe be something people/future students can use down the road.
Given all of the different resources we have access to, I felt that this was a good way to compile everything as I worked through the various problems on the document.

This helped me practice problems from every topic we discussed, but in particular, I learned the ins and outs of converting a regex to an NFA and the pumping lemma/proofs by contradiction.

The one doc titled "Theory of Computing Crash Course" is attached.
